Dolittle is an open-source, decentralized, distributed, event-driven microservice framework that helps you create [Line-of-Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_business) applications.

The framework is a collection of [C# packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Dolittle) and [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) front-end bindings that make it easy to create event-driven web applications using the [CQRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation) pattern.
