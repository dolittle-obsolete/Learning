# Quickstart
Welcome to the world of Dolittle! In this guide we are going to get you all set up so you can build your own applications using the Dolittle Framework. We will start the basis of what will be a simple ToDo-application.

## Prerequisits
Have Visual Studio Code installed
Have [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed
Have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

To get get started, we will install the Dolittle CLI tool. The CLI tool is often used extensively when creating new applications or adding Dolittle components to it.

## Installing the CLI
#### 1) Install the Dolittle CLI tool
```console
npm install -g @dolittle/cli
```

#### 2) Test if the CLI tool works
Run dolittle in your command window, it should output the supported commands.
```console
dolittle
```

## Building your first application
#### 1) Create a new application
We will use the cli tool to create a new application.

The first thing we need is a folder where our application will live.
Create a new folder somewhere on your computer, and name it ToDolittle.
```console
mkdir ToDolittle
```

Go into that folder:
```console
cd ToDolittle
```

To create a new application using the CLI tool, we will use the dolittle create application command.
```console
dolittle create application ToDolittle
```

The application has now been created. 

#### 2) Create a bounded context
Each application needs to have one or more Bounded Contexts. We will use the CLI tool to add a Bounded Context to our application.
```console
dolittle create boundedcontext TodoTracking
```

A bounded context is now added to the application, located inside the TodoTracking folder.

This folder is based on the Bounded Context boilerplate and will contain everything you need to run the Dolittle template application.

#### 3) Open the application in Visual Studio code
Launch Visual Studio Code and open the ToDolittle folder as the project, or open it directly from the application folder from a Terminal.
```console
code .
```

#### 4) Build and Run the Template Application
To run the application, we will use the Dolittle CLI tool again. From the TodoTracking folder, run the following command.
```console
dolittle run
```

#### 5) The template application
You should see our template app running on localhost.

## Using our Dolittle Extension in Visual Studio Code
We also have an extension for Visual Studio Code that allows you to add Dolittle components to you app without using the CLI tool, if you prefer that.

# Continue learning
We have created a Getting Started lesson that will take you through all the steps needed to build a ToDo application that has a Dolittle backend, and an Aurelia frontend.
